# Effects-of-Album-Reviews-on-Consumers
There are currently more reviews on products than ever before. With the increased availability of information due the internet, more consumers are reading online reviews about products and services to gauge if that service or product is worthwhile. Currently certain industries, such as the film industry, are advertising these reviews to generate more success for their upcoming films. However, industries such as the music industry, do not know the effects that these reviews bring. In this paper I will discover, using a survey consisting of University of Maryland students, if music reviews have an influence on consumers. The results concluded that consumers are not very influenced from music reviews in general however, consumers are slightly more influenced by consumer reviews than editorial reviews.
